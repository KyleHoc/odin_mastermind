This program generates four digits between 1 and 6, and asks the user to try and guess the numbers in the correct order, providing twelve attempts to get it right. Each number can only be used once, so there will be no repeats.

For each attempt, the program will display feedback to help the user determine how close their guess was

Key:
X = default, represents the absence of a correct number
O = correct number, wrong spot
@ = correct number, correct spot
